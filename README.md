Develop a Express application with TypeScript as the programming language, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for effective data management. Ensure data integrity through validation using Joi/Zod.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): You can download and install them from https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- MongoDB: You can download and install MongoDB and Moongose.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies. npm install

2. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Rename .env.example file to .env
Update .env file with your MongoDB connection URI and any other necessary configuration variables
   

## Running the Application

To start the application, npm run start:dev
The server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.
You can see package.json file all scripts is written.

## Testing

To run tests or execute.
You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.

## Development

For development purposes, you can run the application in watch mode. This will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the source files.
